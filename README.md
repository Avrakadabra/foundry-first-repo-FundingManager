1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/avrakadabra/fundme-contract.git
    cd fundme-contract
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Deploy the contract:

    ```

## Usage

### Creating a Campaign

To create a new funding campaign, call the `createCampaign` function with the desired parameters:

```solidity
function createCampaign(uint256 _goal, uint256 _deadline) public {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Contributing to a Campaign

To contribute to a campaign, call the `contribute` function with the campaign ID and the amount to contribute:

```solidity
function contribute(uint256 _campaignId) public payable {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Withdrawing Funds

To withdraw funds from a successful campaign, call the `withdraw` function with the campaign ID:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _campaignId) public {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Campaign

```solidity
// Create a campaign with a goal of 10 ETH and a deadline of 30 days
createCampaign(10 ether, 30 days);
```

### Example 2: Contributing to a Campaign

```solidity
// Contribute 1 ETH to campaign with ID 1
contribute(1) { value: 1 ether };
```

### Example 3: Withdrawing Funds

```solidity
// Withdraw funds from campaign with ID 1
withdraw(1);
```
